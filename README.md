# FilmMakers: an app prototype to present delightful interactions in iOS apps

This is the companion code to the article [Delight in iOS apps: crafting user experiences that promote discovery](https://www.expertlead.com/blog/delight-in-ios-apps-crafting-user-experiences-that-promote-discovery).

There are three main stages to this example, to be accessed through the designated tags:

1. Basic prototype (tag "basic_prototype")

2. Tap to expand (tag "animate_with_tap")

   ![](vids/02_tap_to_expand.gif)

3. Pan/swipe to expand (tag "animate_with_pan")

   ![](vids/03_pan_to_expand.gif)

These steps represent an progressive effort to add a more dynamic UI that responds to users intention to discover new content in a playful and responsive manner.
